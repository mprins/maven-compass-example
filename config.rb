# To enable relative paths to assets via compass helper functions. Uncomment:

# To disable debugging comments that display the original location of your selectors. Uncomment:
# line_comments = false


# If you prefer the indented syntax, you might want to regenerate this
# project again passing --syntax sass, or you can uncomment this:
# preferred_syntax = :sass
# and then run:
# sass-convert -R --from scss --to sass src/main/sass/scss scss && rm -rf sass && mv scss sass
